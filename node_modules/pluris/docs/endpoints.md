Exports Endpoints file. If you are receiving the following error:
```
UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Error [ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED]: Package subpath './lib/rest/Endpoints' is not defined by "exports" in /node_modules/eris/package.json
```
Please install the dev branch of Eris by doing `npm i abalabahaha/eris#dev`. This is fixed in [PR 997](https://github.com/abalabahaha/eris/pull/997) and will make the full release in >=v0.13.4

I'm not going to provide the list of properties here since there are too many. If you really want to document this, feel free to open a PR.
